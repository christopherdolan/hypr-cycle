# hypr-cycle

A fast, minimal Rust utility to cycle through workspaces on the **currently focused monitor** in [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland). Unlike `hyprctl dispatch workspace e+1`, this tool avoids switching workspaces on the wrong monitor in multi-monitor setups.

Written entirely by ChatGPT.

## üîß Features

- Cycles only the workspaces **bound to the focused monitor**
- Wraps around when reaching the end or beginning
- Fast, clean, and dependency-free (uses `hyprctl` under the hood)
- Written in Rust for performance and reliability

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
